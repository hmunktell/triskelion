triskelion
==========

3d Delta printer

"A triskelion (or triskele) is a symbol with threefold rotational symmetry (such symmetry means that a figure, which has it, looks the same after a certain amount of rotation). Translated from Greek the word triskelion means ‘three-legged’."

This is my attempt to build a 3D printer much inspired from Johann's great Rostock.
